# SoldierAI-behaviour-tree
Saber Interactive Test

In this test I must create AI behaviour scheme in Behaviour tree notation fonded of this rules:

1) A soldier is an entity that can shoot, go to a specified point and wait.
2) He patrols in a loop around points A and B.
3) Arriving at the point, the soldier stops for 5 minutes waiting for the enemy. If the enemy does not appear within 5 minutes, the soldier moves on to the next point.
4) If an enemy is detected, the soldier fires at him with a 1 second pause between each shot.
